### Using the Application as a Customer

1. Ensure you *git clone* the repository.  Use your terminal/bash to *cd* into the directory.  Then, to run the file, you'll need to input *node bamazomCustomer.js*.

2. You will then be connected as indicated by the connection id that is logged in your terminal/bash.  All of the products in the inventory will be logged as well.  Their IDs, names, departments, and price will be logged.  You will then be prompted to type in the ID of the product you want to purchase.

3. If you input an ID that is not a number, there will be no response.  If you input an ID that is a number but does not exist in the inventory, a message will be logged, telling you that it does not exist.  You will then be prompted to input another ID.

When you input an ID that does exist in the inventory, the product associated with that ID will have its ID, name, department, and price logged in the terminal/bash.  You will then be prompted to input the number of units that you would like to purchase.

4. If you input a value that is not a number, there will be no response.  If you input a number, the application will check to see if there are enough units of that product in stock for you.  If there are enough units, your purchase will be processed.  The inventory will be updated to reflect the new stock quantity for that product.
